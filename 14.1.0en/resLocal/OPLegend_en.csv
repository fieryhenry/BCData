After the Battle Cats invaded the world|
they moved to the next step of their plan…|
|
I thought what they wanted was|
to blend into our world and|
live a cozy and peaceful life…|
…|
I was wrong.|
|
|
The Battle Cats took over|
nuclear power plants|
all over the world.|
|
They were trying to feed|
all the world's power into one place!|
|
|
Their mission was really…|
Time Travel!|
|
|
|
A couple of days ago I ran into|
The Marketing Manager of the Battle Cats|
(He was a Cat) and we had a chat, but|
I don't think he knew what|
Strictly Confidential|
meant.|
|
|
So I knew their plan,|
but I was too busy playing games|
and going out.|
Oh, I also paid a visit to my folks too.|
I'm a good kid.|
Trust me.|
… and so I forgot about their plan.|
|
We need to release the Legendary Cats!|
We need free them before they were sealed!|
We need to travel in time!|
We need some Cat Food!|
|
… I think that was what the Cat was saying.|
Though I can barely remember,|
because I was pretty drunk too.|
|
|
Oh right,|
I was having some nuts with my beer.|
|
|
So anyway,|
they succeeded in time travel|
and the Battle Cats traversed to|
another world.|
|
They remembered to shut down|
all the nuclear power plants safely|
and even left a note saying|
Thank you|
|
… I guess|
They aren't so bad after all?|
|
|
Hey, I forgot to add|
You know Cat God? Yeah, THAT Cat God.|
He is around 20 years old.|
|
So…|
He shouldn't exist in the past… Yet.|
