|
And so, the army of Cats that freed|
the Cats of Uncanny Legend|
conquered the distant past...|
|
|
At last|
|
thanks to the efforts of the Cat Army and|
the Legendary Cats, all of Catkind begins|
to experience a rebirth.|
|
...Or so they thought.|
In the end|
the present day is not overrun with Cats|
as they might have hoped.|
|
|
The one thing that has changed|
is that there is a small increase in|
the number of people that can live carefree.|
|
That is all.|
|
|
Oh, yeah, that's right...|
Some Cat professors came to|
the cafe I opened after leaving my|
office job. They were talking to each other.|
|
|
When the Cats of the past saved|
the Legendary Cats, they met|
humanity's ancestors|
and became friendly with them.|
|
After that, an ancient god appeared|
from a shining gold tree, proclaiming,|
"I task thee with finding a sage from|
another world."|
|
In the swirling energy in the night sky,|
it drew a golden can of Cat Food, then left.|
|
|
I remember taking their order|
for a cafe au lait with no coffee|
and being confused as to how to make it.|
|
|
|
Who exactly is the sage in |
the proclamation from the ancient god...?|
|
I can't even imagine who it could be.|
|
I bet that the Cats have probably |
gone off to yet another world chasing down |
more Cat Food! Heh heh!|
|
|
|
And with that, I must say...|
|
|
Congratulations,|
Battle Cats!|
Safe travels,|
Battle Cats!|
|
Onward...|
to the Zero World!|
