Behold, it is I, Priest Mamon!|
Dread master of the Realms of Aku!|
...Nice to meet you.|
|
Soon, my nine-year long |
quest to bring the Aku Realms |
under my total domination will|
enter its final stage...|
|
|
It has been a perilous journey...|
|
Endless foreboding! Constant agonies!|
Pandemonium! Wickedness rampant!|
Tedium, disgrace and obligation!|
|
I get a little emotional just|
remembering all those good times.|
|
|
Little by little, we have drawn life|
force from other realms to weaken|
the arcane seals that have trapped |
the Lord of Ruin in eternal slumber.|
|
We will add the power of the revived|
Lord of Ruin to our legion of evil, and|
complete our rule of the Aku Realms.|
|
|
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!|
MWAHAHAHAHA... ha...|
|
|
...what's this??|
A weirdly cute army, brimming with|
life energy, have broken the barrier|
between mortal realms and our world.|
|
The Gates of Aku have opened!|
|
|
We must seal the Gates before...|
What's this? "Meow meow"?!?!|
How uncouth! How annoying!|
|
|
No matter.|
Such foolish creatures...|
let us call them... "Cats"...|
We shall deal with them in time.|
|
|
There are more pressing matters:|
A crystal of awakening has been|
found in the caldera of Mount Aku!|
|
We must find it immediately!|
With the crystal's power, the ritual of|
rebirth for the Lord of Ruin can begin!|
|
And if some fool does dare interfere...|
the dark magics of the Aku Altars|
will weaken them enough that our|
armies can crush them with ease.|
|
A flawless plan! We cannot be stopped!|
|
|
|
And so...|
The Aku Realms: Dark Priest's Desire|
begins! MWAHAHAHAHA!!!!|
