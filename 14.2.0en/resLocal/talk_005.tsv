1	0	10th Anniversary Memorial<br>Parade Intermission Event!<br><flash>Pt.3 Cat Talk</flash><br>on now!	2	
2	0	If we reach the end of our<br>conversation, I'll give you a gift: <br><flash>a large amount of a certain item!</flash>	3	
3	0	It's been 10 years since the Cats<br>started their invasion.<br>So much has happened since then.	4	
4	0	They invaded the future and space,<br>and even the Aku Realms.<br>They've even made Cat shrines...	5	
5	0	A Cat even became Prime Minister<br>and a Hollywood movie starring<br>a Cat became a huge hit...	6	
6	0	It’s been an exciting 10 years!	7	
7	0	But there are still a lot of<br>things that many people don't<br>know about The Battle Cats.	8	
8	0	And because of that, I have<br>prepared a quiz to spread more<br>The Battle Cats knowledge.	9	
9	0	These are questions based off of<br>lesser-known The Battle Cats<br>info! Let's start with question 1!	10	
10	0	【Q1】Over 650 different Cats<br>have been discovered and can<br>become a part of your Cat army.	11	50
11	0	Are you sure it's ○?<br>Well, it's time to reveal the answer!	12	
12	0	The correct answer is...	13	
13	0	...	14	
14	0	...	15	
15	0	It’s ○! <flash>Good answer!</flash>	16	
16	0	At first, there weren't very<br>many units to choose from, but<br>that number has increased<br>so much!	17	
17	0	Your Cat Army has likely grown<br>in strength a lot in 10 years!	18	
18	0	This is a result of all of the<br>effort I've been putting in<br>every day, that's for sure!	19	
19	0	Oh! The special sale is going to<br>start at the supermarket soon!	20	
20	0	That's all for today!<br>Let's continue this tomorrow!	21	
21	16	There is still much left to learn!<br>Come back tomorrow for more!	100	
50	0	Nope! That's not it. Do you think it's<br>less than that? There are<br>actually far more than that!	51	
51	0	I may have asked too difficult<br>of a question for the first one.	52	
52	0	You'll have to restudy your<br>Battle Cats knowledge now that<br>you've got the correct<br>answer!	53	
53	0	If you repeat it enough times it'll<br>stick in your memory!<br>At least, that's what<br>someone smarter than<br>me claims!	10	
100	0	Aaaah... I'm sleepy.<br>10th Anniversary Memorial<br>Parade Intermission Event!<br><flash>Pt.3 Cat Talk</flash> is back!	101	
101	0	I've been wanting to make ramen<br>soup from scratch. I read recipes<br>throughout the night,<br>and now it's morning.	102	
102	0	Having days like<br>that isn't all that bad.	103	
103	0	We finished question 1<br>yesterday, so next is...	104	
104	0	...	105	
105	0	Question 2!<br>I've been thinking about the<br>ingredients I forgot yesterday.	106	
106	0	I haven't been able to remember<br>what they were, so I'll have<br>Tank Cat check on that later.	107	
107	0	Now, let's get to question 2!	108	
108	0	【Q2】The opening of the game<br>mentions New Year's Eve 2024.<br>Next year, it will change to 2025.	109	150
109	0	Is it ○? Are you sure that you<br>read the question correctly?	110	
110	0	The answer is...	111	
111	0	...	112	
112	0	It’s ○! <flash>Good answer!</flash>	113	
113	0	2024 is written right now,<br>but next year, that will change<br>to 2025!	114	
114	0	Why is it like this?<br>Well, I can't say for sure.	115	
115	0	I think that during New Year's Eve<br>of this tenth year, something<br>significant will happen.	116	
116	0	...	117	
117	0	No promises, though.	118	
118	0	There are many things in<br>the world that are still unknown.	119	
119	0	Oh, it's study time.<br>We'll continue the quiz tomorrow.	120	
120	0	I'll be going to my Capoeira class<br>today for the first time in a while.	121	
121	0	I don't leave my house that much,<br>so I'm worried that I've forgotten<br>how to get to the class.	122	
122	16	Anyway,<br>see you tomorrow!	200	
150	0	Is it ×?<br>Are you sure?	151	
151	0	This is just between us:<br>I checked up on this<br>last New Year's Eve.	152	
152	0	2023 was written there<br>at the time. Then, after checking<br>on it after New Year's...	153	
153	0	It went from 2023 to 2024!	154	
154	0	It's as true as it is surprising!<br>If you think I'm lying, then check it<br>for yourself this New Year's Eve!	155	
155	0	Trust me, and try<br>to answer again!	108	
200	0	I've got muscle soreness from lack<br>of exercise. 10th Anniversary<br>Memorial Parade Intermission Event!<br><flash>Pt.3 Cat Talk</flash> is back!	201	
201	0	I've prepared some valuable<br>info while talking to Tank Cat<br>about muscles. Next is... question 3!	202	
202	0	【Q3】<br>Frying onions, carrots, meat, salt,<br>and pepper and mixing with<br>curry roux produces a dish a curry.	203	250

209	0	You answered that without<br>hesitation. You might be an<br>even better cook than me!	210	
210	0	That may be the case,<br>but I don't remember<br>preparing a quiz like this.	211	
211	0	Hang on... it looks like this is the<br>cooking quiz book that I borrowed<br>from Tank Cat yesterday.<br>My mistake!	212	
212	0	Anyway, back to business...<br>question 4 is next.<br>Only 2 more questions<br>until the prize is yours!	213	
213	0	This is going to be a difficult one,<br>so be sure to focus<br>and listen carefully.	214	
214	0	【Q4】Since The Battle Cats has<br>been around for ten years,<br>I would like you to<br>suggest the game to your friends.	215	
215	0	What? That's not a quiz<br>question? Oh well, don't think<br>about it too hard.	216	
216	0	Anyway, will you listen<br>to my request?	217	260
217	0	I would like for you to<br>suggest that your friends<br>play The Battle Cats.	218

222	0	Tell anyone you can,<br>like people at work or<br>on your sports teams!	223	
223	0	Next is question 5!	224	
224	0	...	225	
225	0	Oh, where's the question?	226	
226	0	I must have dropped it somewhere...	227	
227	0	This is the most important<br>question, so I was sure to put it in<br>my bag before I went to sleep.	228	
228	0	I also put the Cat Food prize in<br>my bag just to be prepared,<br>but the bottom had a hole in it...	229

250	0	I have a special hint<br>for those who chose ×.	251	
251	0	I was talking to Tank Cat<br>yesterday and learned<br>something new...	252	
252	0	Frying onions, carrots, meat, salt,<br>and pepper, and mixing with<br>curry roux apparently<br>produces curry.	253	
253	0	If Tank Cat says it, it must<br>be true. Question 3 was<br>too easy!	202	
260	0	This is a big request from a<br>Cat that reflects your loyalty to<br>The Battle Cats for 10 years.	261	
261	0	If you listen to my request,<br>I will give you 777 Cat Food,<br>so please rethink your decision.	214
