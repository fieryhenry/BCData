And so...|
The Cat Empire achieved total|
domination of the entire universe.|
|
A splendid galactic federation|
by the Cats, for the Cats.|
The cosmos achieved total peace,|
and unlimited cat food for all.|
|
... that's the official story, but|
the reality is a little different.|
Everyone's daily life didn't|
actually change one bit.|
|
The one weird thing is that all|
constellations now look like cats. |
Cats, and only cats.|
|
Or maybe its just me?|
|
Actually, I was at a New Years Party|
for the Cat Army and Alien Empire.|
I only went to be polite, but...|
|
These Cats and Aliens just turned|
their backs and ignored me, talking |
about time travel, mind control, and |
all kinds of obscure technical topics.|
At some point, the world went blurry...|
|
I must have had one seltzer too many|
|
because when I came to I was alone.|
|
Actually, I think that was nice of them|
not to wake me, because I felt very|
well rested for a week after.|
|
|
|
|
Oh yeah, that's right.|
|
I was free one Tuesday, so I went|
to the battlefield with the Cat Army|
to kill some time.|
|
I haven't had such a good time|
since grade school gym class.|
|
What, you believed me?|
Of course I'm not serious.|
|
Well, as the Cat God, I can't just|
leave those guys to lose, right?|
|
And you... you did great, kid.|
I'm going to grant your dearest wishes.|
No, not that one, you creep.|
|
You'll see what I mean. Anyhow.|
|
|
|
Congratulations to The Battle Cats!|
|
Thank You Battle Cats!|
|
Onward... |
to the realm of legends!|
