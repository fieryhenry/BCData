It is the future…|
1st April, 29XX|
On that day, Aliens came to this planet.|
|
|
But, hey, what's this?|
Was it just bad timing?|
The people of Earth brushed|
the visitors off like weirdos.|
|
Their revenge on the humans who|
ignored them took many forms:|
|
Sinking Japan… Psychic activity…|
Mind-control implants… Floating cities…|
Reality television… Unspeakable probing…|
|
|
Sure, some guys weren't too happy.|
But lets not worry about that.|
|
|
Oh yeah, by the way:|
I've been an alien from space all along.|
|
|
The changes we made to earth|
creatures are the symbol of our rule.|
Lately, you see guys on the street|
with THAT growing from their head.|
|
Earth has no words to|
explain what THAT is.|
|
You'd definitely die of embarassment|
if you tried to even describe THAT.|
|
A real gentleman would never dare|
mention THAT in public.|
|
NEVER.|
|
That's how awfully shocking THAT is.|
|
|
|
|
Anyhow, I've got 8 of THAT|
growing on my head.|
|
We had just about invaded|
every country in the world, but then…|
some really troublesome guys|
appeared without warning.|
|
|
|
Their name is… Cat Army.|
|
We heard they'd conquered the past…|
and now they came to invade our future.|
I mean, they didn't even look tired…|
|
|
There's just one thing I|
want to say to the Cat Army:|
|
|
|
♪Aliens aren't so|
bad after all ♪|
|
Well, it is true that we sunk Japan…|
|
Well, lets not waste any more time.|
On to the greatest showdown:|
ALIEN vs CAT|
