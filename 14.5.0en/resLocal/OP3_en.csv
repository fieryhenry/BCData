New Years Day, 20XX.|
On the way home, I began to wonder...|
|
How many years had it been since|
the Great Cat War began?|
And yet, it feels like|
I never hear from you anymore.|
Not even on my birthday.|
|
The cat's meow... out-of-this-world...|
most righteous... top-shelf...|
king of the hill... the big cheese...|
|
No words can express|
the awesomeness that is me.|
|
I guess people are just afraid to get|
too close to true perfection?|
|
But wait...|
I just thought of something!!|
|
Could it be? Am I asking for too much|
from you, my lovely believers?|
|
My bad (lol)|
|
|
|
|
I heard that lately the most popular|
holiday destination is outer space.|
All the celebs are going.|
|
For some reason everyone is totally|
fascinated with Alien fashion.|
It's the biggest fad of 20XX.|
|
You didn't hear it from me, but|
the radiance of the Alien empire|
reaches even my neighborhood.|
|
Well, those space guys still can't|
compete with my glory, of course.|
|
|
It gets pretty exhausting, being|
followed around by crowds of|
stylish people begging for your attention.|
Such is my burden...|
|
The question I get asked most:|
"Where are your trousers?"|
But telling would spoil the surprise.|
|
|
OH!|
|
Here's some big news.|
I just passed by the Cats who headed|
out into deep space.|
|
They had some really important|
information for all of you.|
|
|
|
Those Aliens... they're actually |
not such bad guys after all!|
They're just normal folks like|
you might run into in your hometown|
|
|
Still, the Cats have to invade somewhere.|
And so, the next adventure of|
The Battle Cats begins now!!!|
