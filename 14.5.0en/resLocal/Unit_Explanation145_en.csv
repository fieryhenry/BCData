Cat Base Mini|Who can say why, but this Cat has undergone|rigorous training to become a splendid fort.|His wave attack is actually just loud yelling.|

Cat Base Ultra|Through sheer willpower, transformed themself into|the ideal Cat Base with cutting-edge LAZERBEAMS!|Still makes pew-pew mouth noises when firing.|
