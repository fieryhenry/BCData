After all the battles,|
|
|
The world was overrun by the Battle Cats.|
|
|
A government of the Cats,|
|
|
by the Cats, for the Cats is the new world!|
|
|
Or that's what I thought…|
|
|
In the end,|
|
|
nothing really changed.|
|
|
Well, if I have to say something,|
|
|
I see a lot more Cats nowadays.|
|
|
That's pretty much it.|
|
|
Oh, by the way,|
|
|
I had a "Cat" come into my office|
|
|
for a job interview, he didn't get in.|
|
|
We might be really busy,|
|
|
but a Cat…|
|
|
is just a Cat.|
|
|
However, I do feel lucky if I see one,|
|
|
in the office or at school.|
|
|
Wouldn't you?|
|
|
Anyways,|
|
|
Congratulations to The Battle Cats!|
|
|
Thank you Battle Cats!|
|
|
Battle Cats Forever!|
