And so|
the freshly awoken Lord of Ruin|
was once again sealed into|
eternal slumber by the Cats.|
|
|
Our ambitions of total domination|
of the Aku Realms, plotted for|
so long... all in vain...|
|
|
A netherworld ruled|
by the Cats, for the Cats...|
uniting all planes of|
existence in one grand empire.|
|
|
|
That was the plan, but...|
in the end, nothing really|
changed for daily life|
among the Aku.|
|
|
The one big change is that|
now all Aku pacts with mortal |
beings now include a signing|
bonus of extra Cat Food.|
|
But it's none of my business now...|
|
|
The Seals created by the Aku Altars|
to drain away life energy to the|
dark Realms have all been dispelled.|
|
I too... have lost everything...|
|
|
|
From the shadows,|
I watched the war between Cats|
and the Lord of Ruin unfold.|
|
Just before the Lord of Ruin was|
sent back to his eternal slumber,|
something came out of his mouth.|
|
It looked like the Cats took it|
back as a souvenir. If only I'd|
realized sooner just what it was!|
|
|
And so, several days later...|
|
With my ambitions crushed, I returned|
to the mortal world for the first time|
in many years. Family and friends,|
gathered for dinner and then a|
stroll around the smoking caldera...|
|
And somehow, I felt like I could|
find happiness in a simple life,|
free of domination and destruction.|
|
|
I'LL GET YOU SOMEDAY,|
BATTLE CATS!!!|
Also... thank you,|
Battle Cats...|
|
|
We'll surely meet again,|
Battle Cats. Just you wait...|
|
