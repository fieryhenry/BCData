# Battle Cats Game Data

A collection of game data for The Battle Cats

This is used in my [save editor](https://github.com/fieryhenry/BCSFE-Python)
for item names, cat data, treasure data, etc

The server files were going to be used in
[tbcml](https://github.com/fieryhenry/TBCModLoader), but it now
directly downloads the files from the game server.
I'm keeping them here because it seems like people use them.

Some files (some ImageServer_100600_01 packs) are compressed tar.xz files to avoid
the 100MB limit on GitHub. You can extract them with 7zip or tar.

## Files Too Big After Compression

The following files are still over 100MB after compression and I didn't want to
split the files up, so I have uploaded them to Google Drive.
