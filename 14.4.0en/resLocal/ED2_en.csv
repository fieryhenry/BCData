And so…|
the Alien empire fell before|
the power of the Cat Army.|
|
|
A new world has emerged:|
of the Cats, by the Cats, for the Cats!|
This life will surely become even|
more punishing and cruel! Aaagh!|
|
|
|
Well, that's what I thought.|
|
But…|
In the end, nothing really changed.|
|
|
Well, if I have to say something.|
Cats star in a lot more|
TV dramas these days.|
|
|
That's pretty much it.|
|
|
Now we have lots of cute|
"big sister" characters on TV.|
Aliens became less trendy|
so we don't get parts anymore.|
|
|
|
Hey, do you remember THAT?|
Well, pushing and pulling on THAT|
is the new comedy boom.|
|
|
Oh, one more thing.|
|
I just got back from drinking|
with the Cats…|
|
They were a little tipsy, but they|
seemed very interested in our planet.|
|
I was cornered for over an hour…|
They kept asking things like:|
"Is there Cat Food over there?"|
|
They were so persistent|
I finally just said, "Yeah, sure!"|
|
|
Suddenly their eyes were|
gleaming with childlike joy.|
|
I hear they're building a rocket now.|
|
Do you think…? No, there's no way…|
|
|
Anyhow…|
Congratulations to The Battle Cats!|
|
|
Thank You Battle Cats!|
|
|
Onward into an endless universe!!!|
