Amongst all the global issues,|
civil wars, financial crises, terrorism|
a brand new threat appears…|
The Battle Cats|
|
We found it too hard|
to fight back… because…|
these Cats… are too cute.|
|
We are powerless to their reign.|
We cannot stop their legion.|
|
Come to think of it|
Cats have already invaded the internet too..|
We have the best|
information technology systems|
and use them to look at Cats.|
|
By the way,|
the developer of these Battle Cats|
was interviewed on TV. It went like this…|
|
Why is the new weapon a Cat?|
|
and he answered -|
|
Because I love Cats.|
|
… are you serious?|
|
I just read what I've written.|
It's horrible… so horrible.|
I've forgotten how bad my writing was.|
|
|
My biggest mistake was|
I don't know who I am writing to…|
I remember my days as a kid,|
I wanted to be a major leaguer.|
|
|
Now…|
Now I want to be a millionaire CEO of|
a Social Networking Service.|
|
|
|
|
I mean,|
If you have money,|
You don't need love, right?|
YES / NO|
|
|
|
|
|
|
Whatever the answer is…|
I want to tell you one thing.|
|
|
|
|
|
The "Battle Cats" aren't so bad.|
|
|
|
That's pretty much it.|
