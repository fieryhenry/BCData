And so, having freed the Cats|
trapped in the lands of Legend|
the Cats came back to their own time.|
|
Welcome home, Cats!|
|
Oh, they brought souvenirs! How kind!|
...Chocolate macadamia nuts??|
Well, we were hoping for a bit more...|
|
Anyhow.|
|
With the help of the Legend Cats|
the Battle Cats can finally retire|
and live in peace forever.|
|
...is what I thought,|
but that didn't actually happen.|
|
Someone accidentally sat on|
the time machine's button|
and now the Cats were sent to|
a weird place no one had ever heard of.|
|
(It wasn't me, I promise)|
|
Yesterday, I ran into the Marketing Manager|
of The Battle Cats (again). I didn't ask, but|
he told me a lot of top secret info (again).|
|
It seems like where they ended up,|
the lost Cat Army discovered other Cats|
dressed like bosozoku biker gangs or|
members of idol groups with number IDs|
and other unusual creatures|
|
It was really hard to tell WHEN|
the Cats actually were.|
|
They discovered some of the Legends|
were actually just descendants of the|
real heroes of Legend.|
|
The Cats had also found a dark guild|
researching forbidden knowledge.|
|
Naturally, they were too curious and|
immediately decided to stay.|
There's no helping it, they're only Cats.|
|
I tried to stop him, but he kept talking loudly.|
And the next morning, it was all over the news.|
|
Of course, the government immediately|
demanded answers, but the Cats|
just hid on top of a cupboard until they left.|
|
Anyhow, it seems the Battle Cats are|
the undisputed masters of time travel.|
|
Maybe this time they'll discover the|
REAL ultimate superweapon?|
|
|
|
Go for it, Cats!|
You can do it, Cats!|
Three cheers for the Battle Cats!|
|
Onward...|
to the Uncanny Legends!|
