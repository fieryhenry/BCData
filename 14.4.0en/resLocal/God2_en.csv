I will show you a miracle| a nice one.*Abracadabra! Alakazam!|
Well,|Just choose whatever you want.|
Don't worry|I got plenty of time.|
Still choosing?|You're just as wishy washy as ever.|
Oh sorry, was napping.||
Oh sorry, wasn't listening.||
Anybody wants to be a romantic, even I do.|Only sometimes.|
Miracles happen for Cat Food you have.||
Sometimes I get tired of|being relied on by everyone.|
Now? Really?|I'm busy though..|
Man, what now?|Oh, it's you again.|
People say that men stand tall.|So you stand on tall people? Weirdos.|
Don't you have wings? Oh wait.|If you did, that'd be pretty disgusting.|
Being a god isn't too hard.|It's kinda easy, you know.|
I've been told I'm quite the looker.|What do you think?|
Admit it, it's love.||
Hey, does this job have a retirement age?|I wonder what I should do when that comes.|
You know, when I get angry…|Everyone suffers.|
Cat Food?|I don't hate it.|
God is pretty awesome…|if I do say so myself.|
That miracle, how many times is it now?||
Wait what… that one again?||
Oh come on, really?|You must… really love it don't you.|
I feel… like one with the universe.|Oh? Just me then I guess.|
Even the god has likes and dislikes.||
God's secrets?|Well… that's a secret.|
When I look at you,|I remember my younger years.|
Yeah, you want to be popular.||
Money is the best lawyer.||
Naked has to be God's uniform.||
Am I awesome, or what?||
I want to love more, rather than be loved.|No, I'm serious.|
Amount of Cat Food = Amount of Faith.||
