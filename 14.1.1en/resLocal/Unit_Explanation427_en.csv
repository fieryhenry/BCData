Mecha-Bun|An ancient superweapon rented out from a|mysterious lab. Cat only has a learner's permit,|so its true power is not yet realized (Area Attack)|
Mecha-Bun Mk II|Made some improvements without permission...|Replacing the vintage armor with titanium|definitely violates the rental agreement. (Area Atk)|
Ultimate Mecha-Bun|Even after the fine, Cat couldn't resist more custom|work. Now features experimental tech based on|ancient prototype schematics (Area Attack)|
